### Better Payload Than BTSM 
(For KSPv0.90, waiting for the new amazing btsm for v1.0.x)

This plug-in is about sexier payloads for btsm.  
It changes the small, medium and big payload by satellite-looking equivalent.  
When a payload is delivered, it point toward the body and deploy his antennas.  
I add a payload adapter to allow the launch of multiple small/medium payload.

##### When delivered:
 - The payload decouple itself from whatever you put under it. You can decouple it yourself before Deliver it. The ejection force is negligible.
 - the payload rotate to face the main body. 
 - When it's done, the contract is validated. 
 - After that, the satellite maintain the orientation for all is life.   

Be careful to not push it too far away when playing with it.

##### For the payload adapter:
It's the vanilla payload bay but at 1.875m diameter, with adapter plates at each end.  
If you struggle to put something on an inside node, try placing the payload bay under the payload (and not the payload on the payload bay).
