### Better Payload Than BTSM 
(For KSPv0.90, waiting for btsm for v1.0.x to update)

This plugin is about sexier payloads for btsm.  
It changes the small, medium and big payload by satellite-looking equivalent.  
It add a payload adapter to launch multiple small/medium payload together.  

##### When delivered:
 - The payload decouple itselft from whatever you put under it.
 - the payload rotate to face the main body. 
 - When it's done, the contract is validated. 
 - After that, the satelitte maintain the orientation for all is life.   

Be carefull to not push it too far away when playing with it.

##### For the payload adapter:
It's the vanilla payload bay but at 1.875m diameter, with adapter plates at each end.  
If you struggle to put something on an inside node, try placing the payload bay under the payload (and not the payload on the payload bay).  
If you want to place a fairing, you can use the inner top node for this.
